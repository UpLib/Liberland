In October 2023, Liberland has issues :
* with "Croatian Forest"
* with some Croatian government bodies : police and secret service to name it

Also to keep in mind : atm, even if Croatia doesn't own <i>Gornja Siga</i>, Croatia however administers the area.  
Which is quite normal, since <i>Gornja Siga</i> is accessible from Croatia by land.  
In a sense, we must convince also Croatia that letting Liberland administer <i>Gornja Siga</i> will be a win-win thing. 

Liberland has to take some initiatives to openly prove that we are in no way a danger for Croatia.
Right the contrary.  
All such initiatives would also be beneficial for Liberland.

<!-- 
I took the liberty to list initiatives which could help greasing the wheels.
-->

Openly publish some Liberland's statistics
------------------------------------------
eg population, percentages of country provenance, money ressources, ...  
* publish it
* invite Croatia (and Serbia) to have civil servants visit a Liberland office where they can directly check those statistics  
<br>

Official Croatian observers
---------------------------
Liberland can propose to Croatia to have direct and official observers in some of Liberland's official instances.

Liberland could for example tell to Croatia that we would be happy to invite any of their representatives
in any of Liberland's office in the world.

Monaco is not a direct example.
But Monaco is also a small country, with a big neighbour, and they invented ways to reassure him.

Croatian embassy in Liberland
-----------------------------
Since Liberland is the land owner, Liberland could propose officially some piece(s) of land to Croatia.
(For free, or maybe thru an exchange of pieces of land ?).

This could be advantageous for both sides.
This would allow Croatia to officially own and occupy the concerned pieces of land,
without having no more to worry about occupying illegally those pieces of land.
If Croatia is worried about Liberland and the area, they could use the land they own in Liberland to monitor the area.

Liberland could propose such a deal to Croatia and Serbia.
<br>

Use Liberland as a natural place to host discussions between Croatia and Serbia
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Liberland could then be a kind of "neutral" place where Croatia and Serbia,
having neighbour embassies, could then discuss more easily.
And Liberland, being the host, could of course be a facilitator.
Liberland could be a kind of Switzerland for Croatia, Serbia (and Hungary).

on pourrait imaginer des prises de contact à des niveaux basiques.
Sauf erreur, on fait déjà des choses coté échecs, fottball

<!--
Before opening negociations, we must prepare them.

Un souci est que, même si Liberland considère, à raison, Gornja Siga, comme terra nullius,
même si effectivement la Croatie refuse GS,
pour autant la Croatie considère GS comme une monnaie d'échange, un levier,
bref, la Croatie accorde quand même de la valeur à GS.
Et donc, impossible de renoncer à GS pour 0$.
On peut même penser que GS a plus de valeur que sa simple valeur faciale, dans la mesure où la Croatie
espère en tirer plus.
