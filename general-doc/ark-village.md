Ark village
-----------
Ark village, its not in Siga (mainland) but it is part of Liberland. Ark is bought from the serbian gov so its offical liberland own land.  
Ark village, also known as the Zelena Glava tourist-recreational complex, is a place that Liberland bought sometime in 2020 from 
the special nature reserve park of the "Upper Podunavlje" , the project was started in 2010, but it has not progressed much.  
So Liberland decided to buy the land and with it start a project for the Liberland diaspora, where its residents and locals could get a sense of the country's spirit.  
It hosts the Floating man festival (https://floatingman.ll.land/), a painter colony ARK22, culinary content, to name a few.  
There is also a possibility to sleep there in wooden huts and there is space for tents, 
full citizens can also buy one of the huts and move in completely (it was on VICE, so far one woman lives there permanently).  
I'm not surprised that people don't know, because the community is more closed and their marketing response is weak
