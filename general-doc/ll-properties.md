Liberland just bought the restaurant Plava ruza, an extraordinary harbor for Croatians, Serbians and Liberlanders in Apatin and a great opportunity for investment. 
Message me if you are or know somebody interested. 
It comes with volleyball, basketball and soccer field nearby. 
The restaurant was build in 2006 for 1,2 million euro. 
We plan to tokenize it as one of the first physical shareholding Liberland companies.
