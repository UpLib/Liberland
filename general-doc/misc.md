The latest news article (https://liberland.org/en/news/498-liberland-set-to-become-a-hub-for-network-states)
at liberland.org mentions BitNation.

Please be aware that this project is technically stalled for years,
see the last commits dates on their github : https://github.com/Bit-Nation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitnation
As of August 2022, the bitnation.co domain name had been sold, and the project is considered defunct.

Even their official website (https://bitnation.co/) doesn't speak about bitnation anymore.

The value of the token is ~0 and it seems no more listed anywhere.

imo it is not good advertising to associate Liberland with something defunct like BitNation,
and which btw was more a scam than anything else.
