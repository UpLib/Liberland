il a exist√© une assoc liberlandsa.org, ll settlement association, en 2015. Semble mort en 2023.

Jan : 
Basic uniform of 'Liberland Sume' or 'Liberland Control' (? The latter will lead to arrest very likely?) would be probably a  big step forward in terms of sending signals 'this is not camping, nor squatting or touristic club '. 

It seems me an excellent idea.
Not need to use it to make control in a first phase (so no provocation)
Just some people simply wearing it.
A sleeveless jacket, with mention "Liberland Border Police" would be nice.
We could even put the officer's number in evidence to show them a good example
and something like "we are here to help you" mention.
It seems me impossible for them to arrest anybody, or it would be magnificently ridiculous.

questions :
who are currently (oct 2023) the Liberland senators ?
Existence of Liberland senators is mentioned here and there ... but we have never seen a name.



You have the opportunity to meet and network with our Minister of Justice, Michal Pt√°ƒçn√≠k at the 'Network State Conference' in Amsterdam on Oct 30, 2023. üá≥üá±

The latest news article (https://liberland.org/en/news/498-liberland-set-to-become-a-hub-for-network-states)
at liberland.org mentions BitNation.

Please be aware that this project is technically stalled for years,
see the last commits dates on their github : https://github.com/Bit-Nation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitnation
As of August 2022, the bitnation.co domain name had been sold, and the project is considered defunct.

Even their official website (https://bitnation.co/) doesn't speak about bitnation anymore.

The value of the token is ~0 and it seems no more listed anywhere.

imo it is not good advertising to associate Liberland with something defunct like BitNation,
and which btw was more a scam than anything else.
