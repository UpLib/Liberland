Everything we can do to be positive toward Liberland <b>and the surroundings</b> is useful.  
Wikipedia is a place where we can do things.

The wikipedia pages on which Liberlanders could add material and informations (in many languages) :
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zmajevac Zmajevac is the Croatian nearest village from Liberland, has common borders with LL
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batina 2nd nearest village in Croatia
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kopački_Rit Kopački Rit natural park, in Croatia. The north border of the park quite touches south of Liberland
