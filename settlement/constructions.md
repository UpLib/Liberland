We can imagine building structures hard to destroy.

Parts of the structure, eg big hollow concrete blocks, could be build on a rear base, and brought to Liberland.  
Then, filled with sand and/or concrete made on site.  
Of course, we should do our best to realize something nice.

There seems also to be a lot of sand on Liberty Island and on the beaches.
Maybe this sand is usable to make concrete ?

Building things that no one wants to destroy
--------------------------------------------
If we build houses etc, "Croatian Forest" will automatically destroy them (officially or not)
because atm they don't want anybody to settle in <i>Gornja Siga</i>.  
If we build infrastructure useful to everyone, it is probably less likely to be destroyed.  
We can also build things which would be shameful to destroy, and only prove that the destroyer takes in reality no care of the area.  
Liberland could even inform officially "Croatian Forest" about such construction,
and simply ask them if they intend to destroy it or not.  
Anyway there are probably some infrastucture constructions which need to be build, and will be useful to everyone.  
The rebuiding of the well (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pzh-UBjruE 2023.9.6, 1' video) is an excellent example.  
We can probably find other infrastructure construction to build (or rebuild) here and there on the <i>Gornja Siga</i> 700 hectares.  
Of course, we need to document things precisely, how it is, how it will be, etc. With pictures.  

* repair a damaged path here or there
* reconnect some dead river arm(s) to the Danube, eg near Jefferson square (1st step to provide safe harbor(s)). Venice quarter !
* build a pier for Croatian police
* build a bridge, with a movable part, to connect Liberland mainland and Liberty Island
* identify pertinent trees to plant, and make some plantations here and there
* <i>your propositions</i> ...

Liberland well at Jefferson square
----------------------------------
In my country (France) it is customary to put a strong metal grid on a public well, for obvious safety reasons.  
I propose that we do that for the well at Jefferson square.
And that we have the grid (a nice one) done by somebody in the area.
The grid being heavy and with a clear and indestructible mention that it was purchased by Liberland + the date.

<!-- 
Construction unbreakable, eg monument en blocs de pierre ou en blocs de béton assemblés.

chapelle, église, refuge, monument 
maybe we could decide that Liberland has a patron saint ... and erect a chapel to him.
