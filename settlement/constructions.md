We can imagine building structures hard to destroy.

Parts of the structure, eg big hollow concrete blocks, could be build on a rear base, and brought to Liberland.  
Then, filled with sand and/or concrete made on site.  
Of course, we should do our best to realize something nice.

There seems to be a lot of sand on Liberty Island and on the beaches.
Maybe this sand is usable to make concrete ?

Building constructions surrounded by big trees
----------------------------------------------
Big trees can be cut off of course, but they provide however some protection.

Building with trunks
--------------------
It's not indestructible, but a log cabin is more solid than a simple plank cabin, and also nicer.  
There is all the wood we want there ... but I (strongly) suggest that we purchase the wood from the "Croatian Forest".
At least, we should try.

Mobile sawmill
--------------
A lot of wood will be used for the settlement.
Maybe that complementarily to buying wood, Liberlanders could use the existing local wood ?

<!-- 
Construction unbreakable, eg monument en blocs de pierre ou en blocs de béton assemblés.

chapelle, église, refuge, monument 
maybe we could decide that Liberland has a patron saint ... and erect a chapel to him.

Noter que la maison forestière détruite était construite en petites briques.
Noter aussi que la "Croatian Forests" n'a pas hésité à détruire cette grande maison, en pas si mauvais état,
sans doute en partie à cause de LL.
