We can imagine building structures hard to destroy.

Parts of the structure, eg big hollow concrete blocks, could be build on a rear base, and brought to Liberland.  
Then, filled with sand and/or concrete made on site.  
Of course, we should do our best to realize something nice.

There seems also to be a lot of sand on Liberty Island and on the beaches.
Maybe this sand is usable to make concrete ?

Construction unbreakable, eg monument en blocs de pierre ou en blocs de béton assemblés.

chapelle, église, refuge, monument 
maybe we could decide that Liberland has a patron saint
... and erect a chapel to him.
