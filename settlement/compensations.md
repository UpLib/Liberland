Liberland must offer compensations for taking <i>Gornja Siga</i>
----------------------------------------------------------------

<i>Gornja Siga</i> is an exploited area
---------------------------------------
If you look at pictures from https://e-liberland.org/liberland-map/, you see :
* there are more than 20 kilometers of forest tracks
* a significant part (20% ?) of the Gornja Siga area seems to be a well-maintained forest (trees planted in ordered manner etc)
* other less visible points

Comparison between satellites images in 2007 and circa 2020, show also clearly that <i>Gornja Siga</i>, and the neighbourhood ,
was a harvested area.

This all shows that even if <i>Gornja Siga</i> is a <i>terra nullius</i> (which is certainly the case),
<i>Gornja Siga</i> is by no way an unused or unharvested area.
<i>Gornja Siga</i> is definitely used and harvested by its neighbours, ie Croatian people and Croatian companies, eg "Croatian Forest".  
(Logging is generally planned 10 to 20 years in advance).  
As long as nobody did live in the place "Croatian Forests" did use the place as they wanted, without constraints. For decades.  
For this single reason (which is not the only one), even if <i>Gornja Siga</i> is not in Croatia,
this doesn't mean that <i>Gornja Siga</i> has no value for Croatia and for the neighbours.  
If Liberland and Liberlander speak with Croatia and Croatian peoples, we must take this point in strong consideration.

Imo, if Liberland and Liberlanders want to settle in this area, then we have to negociate some fair compensations with the previous users.

Planted wood
------------
Liberland could :
* either purchase the existing wood/trees
* either sign a contract with "Croatian Forest", allowing them to harvest what they have planted
* in addition, we could eg propose a compensation, diminishing every year, to compensate for the yearly revenue loss
<br>

Hunting products
----------------
Same as for the wood.
