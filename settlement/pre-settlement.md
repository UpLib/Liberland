September 2023, 21th
--------------------
September 2023, 21th, the Croatian police, together with people from Croatian Forests, destroyed all the settlement
in Gornja Siga (https://liberland.org/en/news/490-brutal-croatia-invades-liberland).

There is an obvious asymmetry between the speed to destroy and the speed to build.  
Working 3 weeks to have all the work destroyed in some hours is not a sustainable (neither serious) way to settle.

As much it is absolutely understandable that many Liberlanders are impatients to settle,
as much it is important to insure a settlement will be done in good conditions,
ie without being afraid of material destructions (or worse).

Liberland : Requirements <b>before</b> settling
-----------------------------------------------
As when installing a software, there are requirements to fulfill.  
<b>If we don't fulfill the requirements at first, the installation will simply fail.</b>  
(and we'll lose time, energy and money).

So, before any new serious settlements attempts, Liberland and Liberlanders have several issues to face :  
* The top priority issue imo is :  
<b>Liberland must reach an agreement with the people living in the area and using Gornja Siga</b>

And concluding agreements with our neighbours also implies on our part to achieve a certain number of things.  
And it will probably take time. So, the sooner we begin, the better.

There are other important (and more technical issues), but if Liberland is unable to reach an agreement 
with Croatia and Croatian local peoples and entities (eg "Croatian Forests"), 
Liberlanders will never be able to settle in Gornja Siga.  
Expecting being able to settle by force and/or without the agreement of our Croatian neighbour is imo a dead end.

So, let's use our skills, brains (and money !) to explore how this can be done.  
Better use our time and energy to discuss with Croatia and Croatian entities concerned by Gornja Siga,
than use this time in other unproductive tracks.  
Let's be positive.


Pre-settling : Building things that no one wants to destroy
------------------------------------------------------------
If we build houses etc, "Croatian Forest" will automatically destroy them (officially or not) because atm they don't want anybody to settle in <i>Gornja Siga</i>.  
If we build infrastructure useful to everyone, it is probably less likely to be destroyed.  
We can also build things which would be shameful to destroy, and only prove that the destroyer takes in reality no care of the area.  
Liberland could even inform officially "Croatian Forest" about such construction,
and simply ask them if they intend to destroy it or not.  
Anyway there are probably some infrastucture constructions which need to be build, and will be useful to everyone.  
The rebuiding of the well (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pzh-UBjruE 2023.9.6, 1' video) is an excellent example.  
We can probably find other infrastructure construction to build (or rebuild) here and there on the <i>Gornja Siga</i> 700 hectares.  
Of course, we need to document things precisely, how it is, how it will be, etc. With pictures.  

* repair a damaged path here or there
* finish or repair some existing constructions which are abandonned or left in place
* reconnect some dead river arm(s) to the Danube, eg near Jefferson square (1st step to provide safe harbor(s)). Venice quarter !
* prepare strong places where to moore and/or to ground properly some houseboats
* build a pier for Croatian police
* build a bridge, with a movable part, to connect Liberland mainland and Liberty Island
* settle with non-private constructions in a first phase, eg if we realize some plantation, have a construction devoted to the plantation monitoring
* identify pertinent trees to plant, and make some plantations here and there
* <i>your propositions</i> ...

Example of construction : Liberland well at Jefferson square
------------------------------------------------------------
It is customary everywhere to put a strong metal grid on a public well, for obvious safety reasons.  
I propose that we do that for the well at Jefferson square.
And that we have the grid (a nice one) done by somebody in the area.
The grid being heavy and with a clear and indestructible mention that it was purchased by Liberland + the date.
