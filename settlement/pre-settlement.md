--------------------
September 2023, 21th, the Croatian police, together with people from Croatian Forests, destroyed all the settlement
in Gornja Siga (https://liberland.org/en/news/490-brutal-croatia-invades-liberland).

There is an obvious asymmetry between the speed to destroy and the speed to build.  
Working 3 weeks to have all the work destroyed in some hours is not a sustainable (neither serious) way to settle.

As much it is absolutely understandable that many Liberlanders are impatients to settle,
as much it is important to insure a settlement will be done in good conditions,
ie without being afraid of material destructions (or worse).

Liberland : Requirements <b>before</b> settling
-----------------------------------------------
As when installing a software, there are requirements to fulfill.  
<b>If we don't fulfill the requirements at first, the installation will simply fail.</b>  
(and we'll lose time, energy and money).

So, before any new serious settlements attempts, Liberland and Liberlanders have several issues to face :  
* The top priority issue imo is :  
<b>Liberland must reach an agreement with the people living in the area and using Gornja Siga</b>

And concluding agreements with our neighbours also implies on our part to achieve a certain number of things.  
And it will probably take time. So, the sooner we begin, the better.

There are other important (and more technical issues), but if Liberland is unable to reach an agreement 
with Croatia and Croatian local peoples and entities (eg "Croatian Forests"), 
Liberlanders will never be able to settle in Gornja Siga.  
Expecting being able to settle by force and/or without the agreement of our Croatian neighbour is imo a dead end.

So, let's use our skills, brains (and money !) to explore how this can be done.  
Better use our time and energy to discuss with Croatia and Croatian entities concerned by Gornja Siga,
than use this time in other unproductive tracks.  
Let's be positive.
