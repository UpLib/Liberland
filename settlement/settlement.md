Liberland settlement
--------------------
* Liberland is connected to Croatia by at least 3 tracks (on the north side). That's the only access by land.  
* Liberland is also technically accessible by boat by the Danube river (which is <i>international water</i>) -> see [boat-settlement.md](/settlement/boat-settlement.md)
