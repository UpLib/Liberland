Liberland geography
-------------------
* https://e-liberland.org/liberland-map/ Liberland maps

The territory is 7 square kms (3 times Monaco). It's a nice area for a small population.  
Liberland is connected to Croatia by at least 3 tracks (on the north side).  
Liberland is physically separated from Serbia by the Danube (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danube).  
There are few bridges on the Danube. Fortunately, there is one bridge at Batina, which is not far from Liberland.

A number of things as to be done before continuing to push the settlement.
- discuss with HUME
- have our own private port (Apatin ?)
- build a port in Gornja Siga


Mobile sawmill
--------------
A lot of wood is used for the settlement.
Maybe that complementarily to buying wood, Liberlanders could use the existing local wood ?
