About the wood
--------------
* Liberland has a lot of trees. A big part of Liberland trees have been planted by Croatia and Croatian people, since decades.
* Liberland settlement will use a lot of wood, and probably big trunks.  

We can't just show up at <i>Gornja Siga</i> and cut down the trees as if they had fallen from the sky.
These are not correct ways to proceed.

Since Liberland will need a lot of wood, I strongly urge us to first purchase the wood from the "Croatian Forests" (CF).  
Of course there is a great probability that they refuse.  
But this is not a reason not to try it at least.  
Even if they refuse, this will show Liberland's goodwill.

Planted wood
------------
On the long term, it would also be fair to either buy the existing already planted wood,
or to let the "Croatian Forest" continue their ongoing work there.  
(Logging is generally planned 10 to 20 years in advance).

Liberland could :
* either purchase the existing wood/trees (good way to make contact)
* either sign a contract with "Croatian Forest", allowing them to harvest what they have planted
* ask CF to cut down the trees we want to be cutted, for us, and pay CF for that (more direct selling is impossible for them)
* in addition, we could eg propose a compensation, diminishing every year, to compensate for the yearly revenue loss

proposer d'échanger eg des droits d'exploitation dans GS contre du terrain à l'extérieur.

You cannot propose 0$ for something to somebody who thinks that the something has value.
Not only has value, but brings him revenue every year.

In October 2023,
a very necessary (but probably not so easy) task seems to open negociations with "Croatian Forest" 
concerning Liberland settlement and the existing presence of  "Croatian Forest" in <i>Gornja Siga</i>.  

This could be advantageous for both sides.
This would allow Croatia to officially own the concerned pieces of land.

Before opening negociations, we must prepare them.

Une façon toute bête de prendre contact avec "Croatian Forests" serait de leur proposer d'acheter du terrain à proximité de LL.
Du terrain utile pour nous, eg pour embarcadère, pour commencer à créer une zone tampon.

il faut :
* recenser les LL croates
* on devrait identifier les interlocuteurs
* monter un groupe de travail pour aller au contact avec les Croates. ça existe sans doute déjà.
* chiffrer le CA annuel de l'exploitation du bois à Gornja Siga
