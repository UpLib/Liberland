About the wood
--------------
Liberland has a lot of trees.
Liberland settlement will use a lot of wood, and probably big trunks.  
A big part of Liberland trees have been planted by Croatia and Croatian people, since decades.

We can't just show up at <i>Gornja Siga</i> and cut down the trees as if they had fallen from the sky.
These are not correct ways to proceed.

Since Liberland will need a lot of wood, I strongly urge us to first purchase the wood from the "Croatian Forests".
