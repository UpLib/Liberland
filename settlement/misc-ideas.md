Jan (signal, oct 2023) : 
Basic uniform of 'Liberland Sume' or 'Liberland Control'  
(? The latter will lead to arrest very likely?) would be probably a  big step forward in terms of sending signals 'this is not camping, nor squatting or touristic club '. 

It seems me an excellent idea.  
Not need to use it to make control in a first phase (so no provocation)  
Just some people simply wearing it.  
A sleeveless jacket, with mention "Liberland Border Police" would be nice.  
We could even put the officer's number in evidence to show them a good example and something like "we are here to help you" mention.  
It seems me impossible for them to arrest anybody, or it would be magnificently ridiculous.
