Issues with transports and with liberlander boats
-------------------------------------------------
In september 2023, there were [issues with at least 4 boats flying the Liberland flag](https://liberland.org/en/news/494-liberlands-resilience-shines-11-days-after-the-september-21-attack)  
<i>Day 9 After the September 21 Attack : In the aftermath of the attack on Liberland, our vessels - the Liberty, the Bitcoin Freedom, the Swan, and even the Yacht House - have faced their fair share of challenges. </i>

* boats are a good and important mean to help settling in Liberland. Without boats, transport of merchandises to Liberland is actually complicated
* as such, boats need a safespace, a pier, a private port, near <i>Gornja Siga</i>, where they could be protected from agressions  
<br>

Pier/Private port, many benefits
--------------------------------
The Liberland project may see people coming with the wish to settle on Gornja Siga. This is the case in october 2023.  
If the settlement proves to be too hard and/or too risky,
it is also important that the settlers have something useful to do.  
Contributing to design/build 1 or 2 rear bases near Gornja Siga, in some places owned by Liberland,
may have multiple benefits.  
A private port may also be a host for fishermen.

<b>Improve Liberland's logistics</b> : allowing boat/boat transportation, but not only.
Also bike/boat, boat/bike, truck/boat, boat/truck.

<b>Modules building</b> : we may also consider buiding directly huts, or modules, in a rear base, and bringing them to Gornja Siga.
This would made hut/module construction faster and more convenient, eg if the rear base has electricity etc.

<b>Contributing to secure Liberland</b> : owning pieces of land near Liberland could of course help, in many ways, to secure Liberland.

A pier on Zmajevacki Dunavac ?
------------------------------
Zmajevacki Dunavac is a small branch of the big Danube.
it is roughly parallel and 1 km away from Liberland north border.  
If Liberland could buy some land on the west side of Zmajevacki Dunavac,
we could install a small pier there, which could allow to embark merchandises to the Liberland beach.

The location could also become a safe harbour for Liberlander boats.
Very close from Liberland, but more safe.

A potential problem is that the land may well be the property of the "Croatian Forest".
(Many trees seem to be planted in a very ordered manner).

A pier near Ark Village ?
-------------------------
eg directly on the Danube, on the other side of the road ?  
Being near Ark village may be helpful in many ways (and connecting the marina and Ark village may be considered in the long term).  
But building directly on the Danube is probably something complicated (?).  
<br>

A marina in Ark Village ?
-------------------------
The small lake in Ark Village is roughly 200 meters from the Danube.
That's quite a distance.
There is also a road (a breakwater ?) between the lake and the Danube.<br>
Given that building permits are also complicated (and long) to obtain in Serbia, such a project is probably a bit irrealistic.  
<br>


more scalable
En 2023, le Liberland possède plusieurs bases arrières susceptibles de soutenir les efforts déployés à Gornja Siga :
- Ark village à Apatin
- le metaverse
