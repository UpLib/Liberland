Danube Liberland branches
-------------------------
There are at least 2 temporary Danube branches going inside Liberland (see the maps).  
Part of the year, those branches are disconnected from the Danube (the Danube water level being too low), 
and the other part, when the Danube is high enough, the branches are reconnected to the Danube.

* Those branches could be natural channel and natural harbor for boats and houseboats, provided they would be permanently reconnected to the Danube,
and that the branches banks get a little developed.
* Reconnection(s) could also be done in more than one place. But even with only one reconnection, this would made the place enclosed between the arm and the Danube, a safer place.  
With 2 reconnections, the concerned place would be a supplementary island, ie inaccessible by (unfriendly engines).

Reconnecting the Danube branches to the main flow doesn't seem to be too difficult.  
At a first glance, this seems a pertinent engineering job to do.  

The excavated sand should not be thrown in the Danube.
If Liberland develops as expected, we'll definitely need material here and there.
So, either we store the sand somewhere, either we can use it to raise the soil level where it is needed.  
For example, if we plan to realize a bridge, the sand can be used to raise the 2 ends of the bridge.
