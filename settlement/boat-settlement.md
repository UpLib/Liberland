Context in 2023
---------------
The context is the context of the 1st settlement, ie complete destruction commited by "Croatian Forests" in september 2023 (https://liberland.org/en/news/490-brutal-croatia-invades-liberland).

As long as Liberland has no proper agreement with "Croatian Forest", we have to think on other possible ways to settle or pre-settle,
reducing or minimizing the risks of destruction.

Contrary to the near 100% destruction on the mainland settlement, in october 2023, we observe that the "Croatian Forests" :
* don't try to destroy the settlement on Siga Island
* don't try to destroy the liberlanders moored boats

This may change of course, but gives us clues about possible things to do.<br>

Another observation is that the 1st Liberland settlement attempt was ~200 meters from the north border,
Liberland north border being (in 2023) the only path to access Liberland.  
When big vehicles come, such a place lets few time left to do anything.  

Next settlement places could be further away from Liberland's current only entrance.  
This would :
* allow monitoring
* let more time to organize in case of attack

Danube Liberland branches
-------------------------
There are at least 2 temporary Danube branches going inside Liberland.  
Part of the year, those branches are disconnected from the Danube (the Danube water level being too low), 
and the other part, when the Danube is high enough, the branches are reconnected to the Danube.  
Those branches could be natural channel and natural harbor for houseboats, provided they would be reconnected to the Danube.  
Reconnecting the Danube branches to the main flow doesn't seem to be too difficult.  
At a first glance, this seems a pertinent enginneering job to do.
