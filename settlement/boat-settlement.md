Context in 2023
---------------
The context is the context of the 1st settlement complete destruction commited by "Croatian Forests" 
(https://liberland.org/en/news/490-brutal-croatia-invades-liberland).

As long as Liberland has no proper agreement with "Croatian Forest", we have to think on other possible ways to settle or pre-settle,
reducing or minimizing the risks of destruction.

Contrary to the near 100% destruction on the mainland settlement, in october 2023, we observe that the "Croatian Forests" :
* don't try to destroy the settlement on Siga Island
* don't try to destroy the liberlanders moored boats
This may change of course, but gives us clues about possible things to do.
